  // act as a proxy toward Drupal implementation, but leave the responsability
  // to PHP itself via its own session handler to handle it, we cannot hook
  // over the session_destroy() method - we need to find another way. The most
  // accurate one being via hook_user_logout().
  //
  // This is sad, but there's a few other session_destroy() calls in core on
  // which we cannot act upon, such as user account cancelation if the user is
  // the same as logged in one - a very rare case where the only side effect is
  // the user keeping the cookie, but as it will be deactivated anyway, it won't
  // be able to use the site as a logged in user (no security issue).
